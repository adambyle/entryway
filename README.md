# Entryway

Entryway will be an online diary/blogging web application with a focus on focused, ad-free reading and writing and intricate privacy control. For example, Entryway will let you:

* Decide who can view your content on an entry-by-entry basis.
* Organize your content in a variety of ways while being sure it is only being seen by who you choose.
* Designate "subscribers" and "editors" who have special privileges within your journal.

There are a miscellany of other planned features, but for now my priorities are to get a functional program up and running. I have no estimated completion date.

I am a college student who is new to Go. What this means is that this project is far from maturity and stands now as an exercise to grow my skills in full-stack web development. It is an entirely personal project, so for now class assignments will likely be taking priority.
